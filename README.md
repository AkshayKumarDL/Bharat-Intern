# TASK 1
# SMS Classifier Project
This repository contains a data science project focused on building a classifier to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Project Overview
SMS spam has become a prevalent issue, with many individuals receiving unsolicited and potentially harmful messages. This project aims to address this problem by developing a classifier that can automatically identify and filter out spam messages.

The project includes the following key components:

### Data Collection: We collect a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham from various sources.

### Data Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.

### Feature Engineering: We extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data, such as word frequency, to use as input for the classifier.

### Model Selection: We explore multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to determine the most effective model for classifying SMS messages.

### Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing classifier.

### Model Deployment: The final selected model is deployed as a standalone application or integrated into existing systems to classify incoming SMS messages in real-time.
