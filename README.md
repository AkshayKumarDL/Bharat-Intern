# TASK 1
# SMS Classifier Project
This repository contains a data science project focused on building a classifier to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Project Overview
SMS spam has become a prevalent issue, with many individuals receiving unsolicited and potentially harmful messages. This project aims to address this problem by developing a classifier that can automatically identify and filter out spam messages.

The project includes the following key components:

### Data Collection: 
We collect a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham from various sources.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.

### Feature Engineering: 
We extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data, such as word frequency, to use as input for the classifier.

### Model Selection: 
We explore multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to determine the most effective model for classifying SMS messages.

### Model Evaluation: 
We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing classifier.

### Model Deployment: 
The final selected model is deployed as a standalone application or integrated into existing systems to classify incoming SMS messages in real-time.


# TASK 2
# Titanic Classification Project
This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to build a classifier that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Project Overview
The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to analyze and predict survival outcomes for passengers on board the Titanic based on passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.

The project includes the following key components:

### Data Collection: 
We gather data from various sources including the Kaggle Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, visualize relationships between variables, and identify patterns that may be useful for prediction.

### Feature Engineering:
We engineer new features from existing ones and select relevant features to use as input for the classifier.

### Model Selection:
We explore multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to determine the most effective model for predicting survival outcomes.

### Model Evaluation: 
We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing classifier.

### Model Deployment: 
The final selected model is deployed as a standalone application or integrated into existing systems to predict survival outcomes for passengers in real-time.
